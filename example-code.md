# Example Code Tutorial

The following example helps you create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC, a subnet, a gateway, a virtual server instance, and then to associate a floating IP address, using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC (Beta) REST APIs.

## Verify access to the Regional API Service

Get an IAM token, source your variables, and verify that you have access to the Regional Infrastructure API service (RIAS) by following these [instructions](how-to-verify-access.html) first.

If you run into unexpected results, add the `--verbose` (debug) flag after the `curl` command to obtain detailed logging information. You also can check out the commonly encountered errors in our [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.html).

If you are using 2-factor authentication, you may wish to refer to [this guide](sl-2-factor-auth.html) for more information.

## List your Virtual Private Clouds

Call the `List VPC` API to list any IBM Cloud VPCs that you have.

```bash
curl $rias_endpoint/v1/vpcs \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

## Create a Virtual Private Cloud

Create an IBM Cloud VPC called `my-vpc`.

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/vpcs \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
      	"is_default": true,
      	"name": "my-vpc"
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

For the rest of the calls, you'll need to know the ID of the newly created IBM Cloud VPC. Paste its ID into the variable, as shown:

```bash
# Something like this: `vpc="35fb0489-7105-41b9-99de-033fae723006"`
vpc="<YOUR_VPC_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

## Create a Subnet

Create a subnet in your IBM Cloud VPC. For example, let's put it in the `us-south-2` zone.

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/subnets \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-subnet",
        "ipv4_cidr_block": "10.0.1.0/24",
        "zone": { "name": "us-south-2" },
        "vpc": { "id": "'$vpc'" }
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

As with the Virtual Private Cloud, save the ID of the subnet in a variable.

```bash
# Something like this: `subnet="35fb0489-7105-41b9-99de-033fae723006"`
subnet="<YOUR_SUBNET_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

## Check the Status of your Subnet

To provision resources in your subnet, the subnet must be in `available` status. Query the subnet resource and make sure the status is `available` before you continue. If the status is `failed`, contact [support](getting-help.html) with the details. You can attempt to continue by trying to provision another subnet.

```bash
curl $rias_endpoint/v1/subnets/$subnet -H "X-Auth-Token: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}


## Create a Public Gateway

To allow virtual server instances in the subnet to have access to the public internet, add a public gateway (PGW) to the subnet.  

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/public_gateways \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-gateway",
        "zone": { "name": "us-south-2" },
        "vpc": { "id": "'$vpc'" }
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

As you did with the Virtual Private Cloud and the subnet, save the ID of the public gateway in a variable.

```bash
# Something like this: `gateway="35fb0489-7105-41b9-99de-033fae723006"`
gateway="<YOUR_GATEWAY_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}


## Create an SSH Key

Create a key with your public SSH key. This key is used when creating the virtual server instance, and it is needed to log into the virtual server instance.

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/keys \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-key",
        "public_key": "ssh-rsa AAA....n",
        "type": "rsa"
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

Save the ID of the key in a variable.

```bash
# Something like this: `key="35fb0489-7105-41b9-8764-033fae723006"`
key="<YOUR_KEY_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

## Choose a Profile and Image for your Virtual Server Instance

Run the APIs to list all profiles and images available for your virtual server instance, and choose a combination.

```
curl $rias_endpoint/v1/instance/profiles -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

To get additional details about the profiles, you can query the global catalog using the IBM Cloud CLI command `ibmcloud catalog entry <profile-name> --json`. For example,

```
ibmcloud catalog entry b-2x8 --json
```
{: codeblock}

```
curl $rias_endpoint/v1/images -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

Save the Name of the profile and the ID of the image in variables, which will be used later to provision a virtual server instance.

```bash
# Something like this: `profile_name="b1-2x4"`
profile_name="<CHOSEN_PROFILE_NAME>"
# Something like this: `image_id="660198a6-52c6-21cd-7b57-e37917cef586"`
image_id="<CHOSEN_IMAGE_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}


## Provision a Virtual Server Instance

Provision a virtual server instance in the newly created subnet. Pass in your public SSH key so that you can log in after the instance is provisioned.

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/instances \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "server-1",
        "type": "virtual",
        "zone": {
          "name": "us-south-2"
        },
        "vpc": {
          "id": "'$vpc'"
        },
        "primary_network_interface": {
          "port_speed": 1000,
          "subnet": {
            "id": "'$subnet'"
          }
        },
        "keys":[{"id": "'$key'"}],
        "profile": {
          "name": "'$profile_name'"
         },
        "image": {
          "id": "'$image_id'"
         },
        "userdata": ""
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

As you did with the other resources, save the ID of the virtual server instance in a variable.

```bash
# Something like this: `server="35fb0489-7105-41b9-99de-033fae723006"`
server="<YOUR_SERVER_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}


You can find more information, including examples about how to provision a virtual server instance with security groups, in our [Security Group Usage Examples document](security-group-usage-examples.html).

## Check the Status of your Virtual Server Instance

Provisioning a Virtual Server Instance may take several seconds to a few minutes. Before continuing, query the status of the server and make sure it is `running`.

```bash
curl $rias_endpoint/v1/instances/$server -H "X-Auth-Token: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

Also save the ID of the primary network interface of the virtual server instance returned in the above API call  

```bash
# Something like this: `network_interface="7710e766-dd6e-41ef-9d36-06f7adbef33d"`
network_interface="<YOUR_NETWORK_INTERFACE_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

**Note: You can't get the primary network interface until you query the specific VSI.**

## Create a Floating IP

Create a floating IP for the virtual server instance, by using the instance's primary network interface as the target for the new floating IP address.

```bash
curl -X POST $rias_endpoint/v1/floating_ips \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token" \
  -d '{
        "name": "my-server-floatingip",
        "target": {
            "id":"'$network_interface'"
        }
      }
'
```
{: codeblock}


Save the ID of the floating IP.

```bash
# Something like this: `floating_ip="35fb0489-7105-41b9-99de-033fae723006"`
floating_ip="<YOUR_FLOATING_IP_ID>"
```
{: codeblock}

## [SSH into your Virtual Server Instance](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/vsi-is/vsi_is_connecting_linux_gc.html#connecting-to-your-instance-using-linux)

To SSH to the server, use the `address` of the Floating IP you created. To get the `address` of the Floating IP, run the following command:

```bash
curl -X GET $rias_endpoint/v1/floating_ips/$floating_ip \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

Use the `address` of the Floating IP to connect to the virtual server instance with SSH:

```ssh -i <private_key_file> root@<floating ip address>```

**Note: SSH access into the virtual server may prevented by security groups. If SSH access is required, you must use an appropriate security group.**


## Delete the Resources

Delete the resources if desired. A resource cannot be deleted if it contains other resources. For example, a Virtual Private Cloud cannot be deleted if it contains subnets, and a subnet cannot be deleted if it contains virtual server instances. On a delete, the API may return quickly but the resource deletion might still be in progress. It is recommended to query the resource to make sure it is deleted prior to deleting other resources.

### Delete the floating IP.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/floating_ips/$floating_ip \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

### Delete the virtual server instance.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/instances/$server \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

### Delete the key.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/keys/$key \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}


### Delete the public gateway.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/public_gateways/$gateway \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

### Delete the subnet.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/subnets/$subnet \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

### Delete the VPC.

```bash
curl -X DELETE $rias_endpoint/v1/vpcs/$vpc \
  -H "X-Auth-Token:$iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}
