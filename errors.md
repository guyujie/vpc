# IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud API error messages
{: #rias-error-messages}

When you receive an error message from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud APIs, you can use the message ID to find more information about how to resolve the problem.
{:shortdesc}

## acl_in_use
**Message**: The network ACL cannot be deleted because it is attached to resources.

The network ACL cannot be deleted because it is attached to resources. Try checking your subnets.

## address_prefix_conflict
**Message**: The address prefix with this CIDR is in use.

The CIDR for the requested address prefix conflicts with an existing address prefix.

## address_prefix_in_use
**Message**: Cannot delete an address prefix in use.

One or more subnets are using the address prefix. You must detach all the subnets before you can delete a prefix.

## backend_service_unavailable
**Message**: The backend service is unavailable.

A backend cloud service that is used by VPC failed to respond. VPC uses multiple IBM Cloud services, such as:

- [Identity and Asset Management](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamoverview) (IAM)  
- [Global Catalog](https://{DomainName}/catalog)
- Resource Controller
- Resource Manager

You can check [status](https://{DomainName}/status) of IBM Cloud services and try again in a few minutes. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## bad_field
**Message**: Correct instance UUID should be provided

One of the values provided in the request is incorrect. Check the `target` value in the error returned for clues as to which parameter was incorrect. In some cases, the UUID or volume in the request cannot be found. Provide a valid value and try again.

Refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias){: new_window} for additional help. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## bad_request                                   
**Message**: The information given was invalid, malformed, or missing a required field.

The request was not what we expected. Use the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias){: new_window} to help you format the request.

If you are following the specification but still get the error, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## classic_access_vpc_conflict_duplicate_res
**Message**: Only one Classic Access VPC can be created.

Only one VPC with Classic Access can be created per region. To list the VPC with Classic Access, run `ibmcloud is vpcs --classic-access`. The existing VPC with Classic Access must be deleted before another one with Classic Access can be created.

## default_address_prefix_not_found
**Message**: Default address prefix not found.

You may see this error message when the default address prefix is not found.

## duplicate_error
**Message**: The input provided already exists.

The resource specified already exists. Try using a different name for the resource you want to create. For example, when creating a new VPC, you can list existing VPCs by running `ibmcloud is vpcs`.  Choose a name that does not conflict.

## floating_ip_in_use
**Message**: The floating IP is in use.

This floating IP is already associated with a network interface or public gateway.

## floating_ip_not_empty
**Message**: Cannot delete a server with a floating IP associated.

Be sure to disassociate the floating IP before you delete the server.

For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias){: new_window}. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## gateway_too_many
**Message**: Can only have one public gateway per zone in a VPC.

Only one public gateway per zone is allowed in a VPC but the one public gateway can be attached to multiple subnets in the zone. To find the public gateway for a zone, run the GET public_gateways API and look at the "vpc" and "zone" values. If using the CLI, you can run the `ibmcloud is public-gateways` command and see the "VPC" and "Zone" value.

Use the public gateway's ID to attach it to a subnet, see an example in our [API examples](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-rest-apis#step-13-attach-the-public-gateway-to-the-subnet-). If using the CLI, you can use the subnet update command to attach it to a public gateway, for example, `ibmcloud is subnet-update SUBNET_ID --public-gateway-id PUBLIC_GATEWAY_ID`.

## http_request_size_exceeded                    
**Message**: The HTTP request is too large.

This problem occurs when the payload you have sent in your request has too many characters. Please try again with a smaller payload. For example, instead of trying to do everything in a single request, try creating a minimal resource in one request, and then appending state to it incrementally in several subsequent requests.

Refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias){: new_window} for additional help. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## security_group_interfaces_per_sg_exceeded
**Message**: Exceeded limit of interfaces per security group.

Attaching another interface to the security group would exceed the limit of interfaces per security group. The quotas per resource are specified in [Quotas and limits for VPC](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas#security-groups-quotas){: new_window}. Evaluate your strategy and consider creating another security group with similar rules.

For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias)
or the [Using Security Groups document](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network-using-security-groups){: new_window}.

If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).


## security_group_last_security_group_is_default
**Message**: The default security group cannot be removed when it is the only security group attached.

A network interface must be attached to at least one security group.
It will be attached to the VPC's default security group if one is not specified.
Attach the interface to a different security group, then try again to detach it from the default security group.
For information on the default security group, refer to the [Using Security Groups document](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network-using-security-groups){: new_window}.

If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

The quotas per resource are specified in [Quotas and limits for VPC](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas#security-groups-quotas){: new_window}. Evaluate your strategy for assigning instances to security groups. It is often possible to reduce the overall number of security groups by assigning multiple instances to the same security group. This strategy will reduce the number of security groups, and drop you below your account quota. In rare cases, generally for large organizations, there is a need for expanding the quota. In this case, please [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support) to inquire if this is possible.

## security_group_network_interface_not_active
**Message**: The interface cannot be attached because it is not active.

Network interfaces must be active before attaching to security groups. Use `GET /v1/instances/{id}/network_interfaces/{id}?version=2019-01-01` or `ibmcloud is instance-network-interface` to view the status of an interface. Once the status is 'available', please try again. If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).

## security_group_not_attached
**Message**: The interface is not attached.

The interface is not attached to the security group. Use `GET /v1/security_groups/{id}/network_interfaces?version=2019-01-01` or `ibmcloud is security-group-network-interfaces` to view attached interfaces.

For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias) or the [Using Security Groups document](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network-updating-the-default-security-group-using-the-cli){: new_window}.

If this problem persists, [contact support](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-help-and-support).


## security_group_not_in_vpc
**Message**: The interface and security group are in different VPCs.

To attach a network interface to a security group, the instance must be in the same VPC as the security group. Use `GET /v1/security_groups/{id}?version=2019-01-01` or `ibmcloud is security-group` to view the security groups details and VPC. Use `GET /v1/instances/{id}?version=2019-01-01` or `ibmcloud is instance` to view the instance details and VPC.

## security_group_order_bindings
**Message**: Cannot delete the security group while it has pending instance orders.

If an instance was created with security group(s) specified on the network interfaces, the instance and network interfaces must be active before the security group can be deleted. Use `GET /v1/security_groups/{id}/network_interfaces?version=2019-01-01` or `ibmcloud is security-group-network-interfaces` to view attached network interfaces and their status.
